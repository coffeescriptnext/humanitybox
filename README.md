Humanity Box
============

Humanity Box is a free ad network designed to increase exposure to individuals
raising funds for personal medical needs.

What does it do?
----------------

Humanity Box works similarly to how paid ad networks work (such as
[The Deck](http://decknetwork.net/), [Carbon Ads](http://carbonads.net/),
[BSA One](http://bsaone.com/), etc). You install an ad code onto your website,
and it delivers advertisements on each page load.

The difference is that the ads in the Humanity Box network are sourced from
campaign providers such as [Wasti](https://watsi.org/),
[GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com/), [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/),
and [Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/).

The ads link directly to the sourced campaign. No money ever exchanges hands
with Humanity Box. It is simply an experimental project for the sake of being
good.

Why does it exist?
------------------

No one should have to choose between bankruptcy or death.

Campaign providers such as [Wasti](https://watsi.org/),
[GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com/), [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/),
and [Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/) are providing a vital service by
allowing people to create funding campaigns to help pay for medical treatments.
Oftentimes, however, the people contributing to those campaigns are limited to
friends, family, and other people specifically browsing the platform looking to
make donations. While this is amazing in and of itself, many campaigns never
reach their goal.

Humanity Box's aim is to bring exposure to these campaigns to as many sites on
the internet as possible. We hope that by simply increasing traffic to these
campaigns we can help them get funded when they otherwise might not.
